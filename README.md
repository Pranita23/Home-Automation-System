# Home-Automation-System
A home automation system will control lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things
Amazon Alexa, known simply as Alexa is a virtual assistant developed by Amazon. It is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, sports, and other real-time information, such as news.[3] Alexa can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation system. We  are able to extend the Alexa capabilities by installing "skills" (additional functionality developed by third-party vendors, in other settings more commonly called apps such as weather programs and audio features)
NodeMCU is an open source LUA based firmware developed for ESP8266 wifi chip. It is an open source IoT platform that includes firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module. By default the NodeMCU firmware uses the Lua scripting language which is based on the eLua project, and built on the Espressif Non-OS SDK for ESP8266. It uses many open source projects.
Our project is an attempt to utilize the benefits of NodeMCU ESP8266 and Amazon Alexa to improvise home automation so that it is more accessible and user friendly. We are also making customization easier and more efficient.
The usual and conventional methods of home automation utilises technologies like IFTT, ThingsSpeak and so on. But these methods require configuration on every platform and this makes the task little cumbersome and time taking. Also, coding part need some calculations for getting characters and decoding them. Therefore the uniqueness of our project involves the use of a library known as fauxmoESP which makes home automation more simpler and easier.
